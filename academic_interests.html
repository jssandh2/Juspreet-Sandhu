<h3 id="academic-interests">ACADEMIC INTERESTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>My Academic Interests lie in <strong>Theoretical Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Mathematics</strong>. I am currently thinking about the following problems:
  <ul>
  <li> The limit of quantum approximate optimization on models from Spin-Glass Theory in Statistical Physics. I am interested in exploring the duality between diluted spin-glass models and random CSPs via the Parisi Variational Principle and the Overlap/RSB structure of these problems, with implications on algorithmic hardness. </li>
  <li> Possible connections between Wigner Function negativity &amp; Sum-of-Squares
    pseudodistributions, particularly in the Unique-Games Conjecture regime. Generically, any connections between RS/RSB ansatze and SoS pseudo-distributions would have interesting algorithmic implications.</li>
  <li> The use of High-Dimensional Expanders in the creation of better Quantum-Error Correction Codes and for provable speed-ups in approximate sampling &amp; optimization algorithms. </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Broadly, my interests are at the intersection of <strong>Spin-Glass Theory, Quantum Inapproximability, Convex Analysis, Optimization</strong> and <strong>Random/Spectral Graph Theory</strong>. I am curious about the average-case complexity landscape of combinatorial optimization problems for large families of (classical &amp; quantum) algorithms. Key tools that I often use in my work are: <strong>Stochastic Processes, Probability Theory, Convexity, Spectral Graph Theory, Spin Glass Theory, Quantum Algorithms &amp; Partial Differential Equations</strong>. </li>
<li> I am fortunate to have some wonderful collaborators. I work very closely on many problems with the wonderful duo of <a href="https://antaresc.github.io/">Antares Chen</a> and <a href="https://www.jshi.science/">Jonathan Shi</a>. I have also worked on some exciting projects with <a href="https://cnchou.github.io">Chi-Ning Chou</a>, <a href="https://ekhabiboulline.me/">Emil Khabiboulline</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tuftsqi/people/jonathan-wurtz">Jonathan Wurtz</a>. 
</ul>
