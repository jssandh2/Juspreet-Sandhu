<h3 id="academic-interests">ACADEMIC INTERESTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>My Academic Interests mainly lie in the (broad) area of <strong>Theoretical Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Discrete Math</strong>. Currently, I am thinking about problems in three  areas. The first is trying to understand the limit of Quantum Approximation Optimization by formally reasoning about shallow-depth QAOA(p) on a large number of models from Spin-Glass Theory in Statistical Physics. The second involves thinking about connections between Wigner Function negativity &amp; Sum-of-Squares
  pseudodistributions, particularly in the UGC regime. The third is the use of High-Dimensional Expanders in the creation of better Quantum-Error Correction Codes and, more generally, the use of High-Dimensional Expanders for problems in Sampling &amp; Optimization. </li>
<li>More generally, I have <em>broad interests</em> in:
<ul>
<li>Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity &amp; Adiabatic Quantum Complexity/QAOA</li>
<li>Quantum Games &amp; Communication Complexity</li>
<li>Spectral &amp; Random Graph Theory, Matrix Analysis &amp; Discrete Fourier Analysis</li>  
<li>Probabilistic &amp; Additive Combinatorics in Pseudorandomness</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
