<h3 id="academic-interests">ACADEMIC INTERESTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>My Academic Interests mainly lie in the areas of <strong>Theoretical Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Discrete Math</strong>. I am currently working on three classes of problems:
  <ul>
  <li> Trying to understand the limit of Quantum Approximate Optimization by formally reasoning about shallow-depth QAOA(p) on a large number of models from Spin-Glass Theory in Statistical Physics. In particular, I am interested in the duality between diluted spin-glass models and random CSPs via the lens of the Overlap Gap Property. </li>
  <li> Thinking about connections between Wigner Function negativity &amp; Sum-of-Squares
    pseudodistributions, particularly in the UGC regime. </li>
  <li> The third is the use of High-Dimensional Expanders in the creation of better Quantum-Error Correction Codes and for speed-ups in approximate Sampling &amp; Optimization problems. </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Broadly, I have interests in the connections between Statistical Physics and Algorithmic Hardness. In particular, I am curious about the average-case complexity landscape of combinatorial optimization problems for large families of (classical &amp; quantum) algorithms. </li>
<li>Key tools that I often use in my work are: <strong>Stochastic Processes, Overlap Gap Property, Probability Theory, Spectral Graph Theory, Spin Glass Theory, Quantum Algorithms &amp; Partial Differential Equations</strong>. </li>
</ul>
