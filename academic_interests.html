<h3 id="academic-interests">ACADEMIC INTERESTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>My Academic Interests lie at the intersection of <strong>Theoretical Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Mathematical Physics</strong>. I want to understand the average-case complexity landscape of different families of optimization problems. Currently, I am thinking about:
  <ul>
  <li> Quantum inapproximability on various models in Spin-Glass Theory. I am interested in exploring the duality between diluted spin-glass models and random CSPs via the Parisi Variational Principle and the Overlap/RSB structure of these problems, with implications on algorithmic hardness. </li>
  <li> Possible connections between Wigner Function negativity &amp; Sum-of-Squares
    pseudodistributions, particularly in the Unique-Games Conjecture regime. Generically, any connections between RS/RSB ansatzen and SoS pseudo-distributions pique my interest.</li>
  <li> The use of High-Dimensional Expanders in the creation of better Quantum-Error Correction Codes and for provable speed-ups in approximate sampling &amp; optimization algorithms. </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>More broadly, I am excited about the intersections between <strong>Spin-Glass Theory, Quantum Inapproximability, Convex Analysis, Optimization</strong> and <strong>Random/Spectral Graph Theory</strong>.</li>
<li> I am fortunate to have some great collaborators. I primarily work very closely on many problems with the wonderful duo of <a href="https://antaresc.github.io/">Antares Chen</a> and <a href="https://www.jshi.science/">Jonathan Shi</a>. I have also worked on some exciting projects with <a href="https://cnchou.github.io">Chi-Ning Chou</a>, <a href="https://ekhabiboulline.me/">Emil Khabiboulline</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tuftsqi/people/jonathan-wurtz">Jonathan Wurtz</a>. 
</ul>
