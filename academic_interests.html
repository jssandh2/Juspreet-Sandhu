<h3 id="academic-interests">ACADEMIC INTERESTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>My Academic Interests mainly lie in the areas of <strong>Theoretical Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Discrete Math</strong>. These days, I am thinking about problems in three areas - The first is trying to understand the limit of Quantum Approximate Optimization by formally reasoning about shallow-depth QAOA(p) on a large number of models from Spin-Glass Theory in Statistical Physics. The second involves thinking about connections between Wigner Function negativity &amp; Sum-of-Squares
  pseudodistributions, particularly in the UGC regime. The third is the use of High-Dimensional Expanders in the creation of better Quantum-Error Correction Codes and for speed-ups in approximate Sampling &amp; Optimization problems. </li>
<li>More generally, I have interests in the connections between Statistical Physics and Algorithmic Hardness, in particular to the understand the average-case complexity landscape of combinatorial optimization problems for large families of (classical &amp; quantum) algorithms. </li>
<li>Key themes/ideas/tools that show up often in my projects/works/musings include: Stochastic Processes, Overlap Gap Property, Probability Theory, Spectral Graph Theory, Spin Glasses, Quantum Algorithms &amp; Partial Differential Equations. </li>
