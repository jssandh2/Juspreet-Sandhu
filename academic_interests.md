### ACADEMIC INTERESTS
* My Academic Interests mainly lie in the (broad) area of **Theoretical Computer Science** and **Discrete Math**.
* To (attempt) to be more specific, I am _particularly_ interested in :
    * Programming Language Theory & Design (Homotopy Type Theory, Category Theory)
    * Cryptography (Classical, Public-Key)
    * Distributed Systems
    * Computational Complexity
    * Combinatorics & Graph Theory
