## ABOUT ME
* **CURRENT** 
    *   I'm a Software Engineer in the **Search & Discovery** (S&D) Team at **Tumblr Inc.**. I work primarily on _Search Parallelization_, _Filtering_ and _Relational Modeling_.
    *   Beginning **April, 2017** I also started working with [**James Wilcox**](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jrw12/) to extend the [**Verdi**](http://verdi.uwplse.org) framework to include more robust *Network Semantics* and provide *Formal Verification* for more *Distributed Systems*.
* **BEFORE** 
    *   Before working, I went to school at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/), where I did my **BS** in **Physics** and received **Minors** in **Mathematics, Computer Science**. I graduated in May, 2015.
    *   While at **UIUC**, I did the following things :
        *   An Independent Study under [Prof. Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) to investigate the effect of Coreference-Resolution on MAP for Search Queries using the [stanford-core-nlp](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) package.
        *   Was a **Grader ([CS-410](https://chara.cs.illinois.edu/sites/cs410))** in Spring, 2015.
        *   A [SPIN Internship](http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/interns/2014.html) at the [NCSA](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) to investigate NLP Algorithms to extract meaningful data from Audio-Conversations by Firemen.
        *   Played Badminton with A-Team for UIUC.
* **INTERESTS**
    *   Besides **Academics**, I have a few other interests :
        *   **Classical Music** : I've been studying Classical Guitar since 2006\. I play a [Cordoba-C9](http://www.cordobaguitars.com/p/c9) for now (Cedar Top). I'm looking into getting an [Alhambra-8P](http://www.alhambrausa.com/guitars/classical/9/8-p.html) or [Alhambra-9P](http://www.alhambrausa.com/guitars/classical/10/9-p.html).
        *   **Badminton** : I started playing Badminton competitively around 2007. I played Zonals and State-Level Badminton in India, and was part of the A-Team at UIUC. Unfortunately, I haven't been playing/training since 2015.
        *   **Photography** : I am particularly fond of Nature Photography, Black-and-White Photography and DSLRs with High-Shutter Speeds.
