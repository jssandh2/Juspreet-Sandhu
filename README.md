## ABOUT ME

* **CURRENT**
    *   I am currently at [**Harvard University**]() as a PhD student in Computer Science, with interests in _Complexity, Algebra & Programming Language Theory_.
* **BEFORE**
    *   I worked as a Research Software Engineer at [**Kensho, Inc.**](https://www.kensho.com/) in the **Graph Infrastructure Team** from _August-3, 2017_ to _July-10, 2018_.
    *   I worked with [**James Wilcox**](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jrw12/) in April, 2017 to extend the [**Verdi**](http://verdi.uwplse.org) framework to include more robust *Network Semantics* and provide *Formal Verification* for more *Distributed Systems*.
    *   I attended [**_OPLSS-2017_**](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer17/) from _June-26, 2017_ - _July-8, 2017_.
    *   I was a Software Engineer at [**Tumblr Inc.**](https://www.tumblr.com/jobs) in the **Search & Discovery** Team from _December-7, 2015_ - _August-2, 2017_. I worked primarily on Search Parallelization, Filtering and Relational Modeling.
    *   Before working, I went to school at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/), where I did my **BS** in **Physics** and received **Minors** in **Mathematics, Computer Science**. I graduated in May, 2015.
    *   While at **UIUC**, I did the following things :
        *   An Independent Study under [Prof. Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) to investigate the effect of Coreference-Resolution on MAP for Search Queries using the [stanford-core-nlp](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) package.
        *   Was a **Grader ([CS-410](https://chara.cs.illinois.edu/sites/cs410))** in Spring, 2015.
        *   A [SPIN Internship](http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/interns/2014.html) at the [NCSA](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) to investigate NLP Algorithms to extract meaningful data from Audio-Conversations by Firemen.
        *   Played Badminton with A-Team for UIUC.



## INTERESTS

*   Besides **Academics**, I have a few other interests :
    *   **Classical Music** : I've been studying Classical Guitar since 2006\. I play a [Cordoba-C9](http://www.cordobaguitars.com/p/c9) for now (Cedar Top). I'm looking into getting an [Alhambra-8P](http://www.alhambrausa.com/guitars/classical/9/8-p.html) or [Alhambra-9P](http://www.alhambrausa.com/guitars/classical/10/9-p.html).

    *   **Photography** : I am particularly fond of Nature Photography, Black-and-White Photography and DSLRs with High-Shutter Speeds.
