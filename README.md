## ABOUT ME

*   I'm a Software Engineer in the **Search & Discovery** (S&D) Team at **Tumblr Inc.**. I work primarily on _Search Parallelization_, _Filtering_ and _Relational Modeling_.
*   Before working, I went to school at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/), where I did my **BS** in **Physics** and received **Minors** in **Mathematics, Computer Science**. I graudated in May, 2015.
*   While at **UIUC**, I did the following things :
    *   An Independent Study under [Prof. Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) to investigate the effect of Coreference-Resolution on MAP for Search Queries using the [stanford-core-nlp](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) package.
    *   Was a **Grader ([CS-410](https://chara.cs.illinois.edu/sites/cs410))** in Spring, 2015.
    *   A [SPIN Internship](http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/interns/2014.html) at the [NCSA](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) to investigate NLP Algorithms to extract meaningful data from Audio-Conversations by Firemen.
    *   Played Badminton with A-Team for UIUC.
*   Besides **Academics**, I have a few other interests :
    *   **Classical Music** : I've been studying Classical Guitar since 2006\. I play a [Cordoba-C9](http://www.cordobaguitars.com/p/c9) for now (Cedar Top). I'm looking into getting an [Alhambra-8P](http://www.alhambrausa.com/guitars/classical/9/8-p.html) or [Alhambra-9P](http://www.alhambrausa.com/guitars/classical/10/9-p.html). I am currently working on the following pieces :
        *   BWV-998 in D-Major (Prelude, Fugue & Allegro), J.S. Bach
        *   Recuerdos De La Alhambra, Tarrega
        *   Danza Brasilera, Jorge Morgel
    *   **Badminton** : I started playing Badminton competitively around 2007\. I played Zonals and State-Level Badminton in India, and was part of the A-Team at UIUC. Unfortunately, I haven't been playing/training since 2015.
    *   **Photography** : I am particularly fond of Nature Photography, Black-and-White Photography and DSLRs with High-Shutter Speeds.
