Proof 1 : Associativity, Non-Commutativity and the Identity Element of the Concatenation Operation of Strings over a Finite Alphabet
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/05/25/proof-1-associativity-non-commutativity-and-the-identity-element-of-concatenation-of-strings-in-a-finite-alphabet-set/ Mon, 25 May 2015 00:04:53 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=16 An input sequence of strings from a given alphabet are given as: $latex w = a\_{1}a\_{2}.....a\_{n}, \\ni, a\_{i} \\in A$, where A is a finite set called the Language. We say that all sequences over an alphabet are in the Kleene-Concatenation, that is: $latex w \\in A^{\*}$, where, $latex A^{\*} = \\{\\epsilon\\}\\cup\\{A\\}\\cup\\{A.A\\}.....$, where, $latex \\epsilon $ is the empty string. Note: $latex \\epsilon \\neq \\phi$ We will show that the concatenation operation that builds up the Kleene-Set is associative, non-commutative and has an identity element. Definition: Concatenation is defined as $latex a.b = a\_{1}a\_{2}...a\_{m}b\_{1}b\_{2}...b\_{n} , \\forall a\_{i}, b\_{j} \\in A$ 1) Associativity : We will show that  (a.b).c = a.(b.c), where,  $latex a = a\_{1}...a\_{l}, b = b\_{1}...b\_{m}, c = c\_{1}..c\_{n} $ For the LHS of the equation, by definition of concatenation, we have that: $latex (a.b) = a\_{1}..a\_{l}b\_{1}..b\_{m} $ So, $latex (a.b).c = (a\_{1}..a\_{l}b\_{1}..b\_{m}).c = a\_{1}..a\_{l}b\_{1}..b\_{m}c\_{1}..c\_{n} $ For the RHS, we have that, $latex (b.c) = b\_{1}..b\_{m}c\_{1}..c\_{n} $ So, $latex a.(b.c) = a.(b\_{1}..b\_{m}c\_{1}..c\_{n} = a\_{1}..a\_{l}b\_{1}..b\_{m}c\_{1}..c\_{n} $ Clearly, a.(b.c) = (a.b).c Therefore, the concatenation operation is associative. 2) Non-Commutativty: We will show that, $latex \\exists a,b \\in A^{\*}, \\ni, a.b \\neq b.a$ $latex a = a\_{1}...a\_{m}, b = b\_{1}..b\_{n}$ By definition, $latex a.b = a\_{1}..a\_{m}b\_{1}..b\_{n}$ and $latex b.a = b\_{1}..b\_{n}a\_{1}..a\_{m} $ We can see that for a.b = b.a, we need that (if m = n): $latex a\_{1} = b\_{1}....$ and ultimately $latex a\_{i} = b\_{i} \\forall i \\in \\{1, m\\}$ However, if they are not equal, we see that commutativity is broken. The creation of complements of strings concatenated together is one simple example of strings that break commutativity. In the event that $latex m \\neq n$, commutativity may be broken by choosing the smaller string to be a substring of the larger one, and $latex \\forall i \\in {m + 1, n}$ arrange the alphabets such that they complement the first $latex {1, m - 1}$ alphabets of the smaller one. Clearly, commutativity does not always hold. Therefore, Concatenation is not Commutative. 3) Identity Element: It is trivial to see that the identity element is the empty string. Now, for the identity element, $latex a.e = a$ and $latex e.a = a$, where e is the identity element. By definition, concatenation with the empty string at the beginning or ending of another string yields the latter string. Therefore, concatenation has the identity element $latex e = \\epsilon$ Note : The fact that concatenation is not a commutative operation over the Finite Alphabet L, tells us that there is no finite basis in any Vector Space made from field elements F = L that can span the Kleene-Concatenation of a Language. This tells us that the set is incredibly rich, and beyond the scope of Linear Algebra with a finite basis. Furthermore, one can see that though there exists an identity element, there exists no inverse element for the operation of concatenation. Reference: 1) Problem D.

Proof 2: The Symmetric Difference Operation over the Power Set of a Set forms a group
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/05/25/proof-2-the-symmetric-difference-operation-over-the-power-set-of-a-set-forms-a-group-i-e-latex-is-a-group/ Mon, 25 May 2015 00:32:14 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=27 We will show that given a Set D, the Symmetric Difference Operator $latex \\oplus$ over the set $latex P\_{D} = \\{ A : A \\subseteq D\\}$ forms a group. So, we will show that: $latex &lt; P\_{D}, + &gt;$ is a Group. Definition: $latex A \\oplus B = (A - B)\\cup(B - A)$ Proof: We need to show that the Symmetric Difference Operator over $latex P\_{D}$: a) is Associative b) has an Identity Element c) has an Inverse Element a) Associativity - In order to prove Associativity, we will show that $latex (A \\oplus B) \\oplus C = A \\oplus (B \\oplus C)$ Let us first show the LHS of the equation: $latex A \\oplus B = (A - B)\\cup(B - A)$ So, $latex (A \\oplus B) \\oplus C = ((A - B)\\cup(B - A)) \\oplus C$ Which is $latex (A \\oplus B) \\oplus C = (A - B - C)\\cup(C - (A - B)$ Now, looking at the RHS of the equation: $latex B \\oplus C = (B - C)\\cup(C - B)$ So, $latex A \\oplus (B \\oplus C) = A \\oplus ((B - C)\\cup(C - B))$ Which is $latex A \\oplus (B \\oplus C) = (A - (B - C)\\cup(C - B))\\cup((B - C)\\cup(C - B) - A)$ Now, this can be written, using $latex A\\cup B = A + B - A\\cap B$: $latex A \\oplus (B \\oplus C) = (A - (B - C + C - B - (B - C)\\cap(C - B)))\\cup((B - C + C - B - (B - C)\\cap(C - B)) - A) = (A + (B - C)\\cap(C - B))\\cup(-A - (B - C)\\cap(C - B)) = (A - B - C)\\cup(C - B + A) = (A \\oplus B) \\oplus C $ Therefore, the Symmetric Difference Operator is Associative. 2) Existence of Identity Element: For the identity element, we need the condition that: $latex A \\oplus E = A$ So, by definition, $latex \\phi \\subset P\_{D}, \\forall D$ Now, $latex A \\oplus E = (A - E)\\cup(A + E) = A $ We see that, if $latex E = \\phi$, then, $latex A - E = A - \\phi = A$ Similarly, $latex E - A = \\phi - A =\\phi$ So, $latex A \\oplus \\phi = (A - \\phi)\\cup(\\phi - A) = A \\cup \\phi = A$ Therefore, the Identity Element is $latex E = \\phi $ 3) Inverse Element: For the Inverse Element $latex \\forall A \\in P\_{D}, \\ni, A \\subset D$, we need to show that $latex \\exists A^{'} \\in P\_{D}, \\ni, A \\oplus A^{'} = E $ Now, $latex (A - A^{'})\\cup(A^{'} - A) = \\phi$ So, we need, $latex (A - A^{'}) = \\phi$ and $latex (A^{'} - A) = \\phi$ Therefore, this implies that $latex A^{'} = A$ Therefore, the Inverse Element for an element A is the element itself. Now, as $latex A \\oplus B, \\forall A, B \\in P\_{D} $ for some D is associative, has an identity element and an inverse element: $latex &lt; P\_{D}, \\oplus &gt; $ is a Group Reference: 1) Problem C.

Proof 3: The operation of Binary error addition of strings across the Binary Alphabet forms an Abelian Group of Error Addition on the Kleene Set of the Binary Alphabet
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/05/25/proof-3-the-operation-of-binary-error-addition-of-strings-across-the-binary-alphabet-forms-a-group-of-error-addition-on-the-kleene-set-of-the-binary-alphabet/ Mon, 25 May 2015 21:58:06 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=76 The Binary Alphabet is defined as $latex \\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$ Goal: We will show that Binary Error Addition (defined below) on $latex \\Sigma^{\*}$ forms a group : $latex &lt;\\Sigma^{\*} , e(+) &gt;$ Motivation: To understand Binary Error Addition, we must know the motivation behind its need: In transmitting information through Binary Code, errors are often made. For a word $latex \\textbf{a} = a\_{1}...a\_{n}$ that has been sent, when a word $latex \\textbf{b} = b\_{1}....b\_{n}$ that is received, the error pattern is defined as: $latex \\textbf{e} = e\_{1}...e\_{n} $, where: $latex e\_{i} = 0$, if $latex a\_{i} = b\_{i}$ else: $latex e\_{i} = 1$ Therefore, Binary Error Addition leads to the following rules: 1 + 0 = 1   (1) 0 + 1 = 1   (2) 1 + 1 = 0   (3) 0 + 0 = 0   (4) Proof: In order to show that Binary Error Addition across $latex \\Sigma^{\*}$ forms a group, we will show that: 1) Binary Addition is Associative 2) $latex \\exists \\textbf{e} \\in \\Sigma^{\*} , \\ni , \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{e} = \\textbf{a} , \\forall \\textbf{a} $ in $latex \\Sigma^{\*}$    (Identity Element) 3) $latex \\exists \\textbf{inv(a)} \\in \\Sigma^{\*} , \\ni , \\forall \\textbf{a}$  in $latex \\Sigma^{\*} , \\textbf{inv(a)} + \\textbf{a} = \\textbf{e}$   (Inverse) While that is enough to show that we have a Group, we will further show that: 1) Binary Error Addition is commutative 2) $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{a} - \\textbf{b}$ : This is an extremely important property, as one shall see below 3) If $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{c}$, then, $latex \\textbf{a} = \\textbf{b} + \\textbf{c}$ : This seemingly bizarre result is extremely important and at the heart of decoding and retrieving originally sent Binary Code using Error Code and Received Signals. 1) Associativity: We can first verify the associative law $latex \\textbf{a} + ( \\textbf{b} + \\textbf{c} ) = ( \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} ) + \\textbf{c}$  for strings of length 1. So, for $latex \\textbf{a} = a , \\textbf{b} = b , \\textbf{c} = c , \\ni , a,b,c \\in \\Sigma $, we can see that: (1 + 0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 0 = 1 + 1 = 1 + (0 + 1) (1 + 1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 = 1 + 0 = 1 + (1 + 1) (0 + 0) + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + (0 + 0) ... and so on, for all 8 possible permutations. We now use this fact to show that the error code addition is commutative over an arbitrary string of length 'n'. Let $latex \\textbf{a} = a\_{1}...a\_{n} , \\textbf{b} = b\_{1}...b\_{n}, \\textbf{c} = c\_{1}...c\_{n}$, then, to show associativity we will show both sides of the required equation to be equal. In the LHS of the equation: $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = (a\_{1}...a\_{n}) + (b\_{1}...b\_{n}) = a\_{i} + b\_{i} , \\forall i \\in \\{1, n\\}$ So, $latex ( \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} ) + \\textbf{c} = (a\_{i} + b\_{i}) + c\_{i}$      (5) In the RHS of the equation: $latex \\textbf{b} + \\textbf{c} = (b\_{1}...b\_{n}) + (c\_{1}...c\_{n}) = b\_{i} + c\_{i} , \\forall i \\in \\{1, n\\}$ So, $latex \\textbf{a} + ( \\textbf{b} + \\textbf{c} ) = a\_{i} + (b\_{i} + c\_{i})$      (6) Using the associativity for single term Binary Error Addition, we see that (5) = (6) Therefore, Binary Error Addition across $latex \\Sigma^{\*}$ is Associative. 2) Existence of Identity Element: We will show that $latex \\exists \\textbf{e} \\in \\Sigma^{\*} , \\forall \\textbf{a} \\in \\Sigma^{\*} , \\ni , \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{e} = \\textbf{a} $ Now, for any string of length 'n', we notice by definition of Binary Error Addition: if $latex a\_{i} = 1$ for $latex i \\in \\{1, n\\}$ , we have that, $latex a\_{i} + 0 = a\_{i}$ else if $latex a\_{i} = 0$ for $latex i \\in \\{1, n\\}$ , we have that, $latex a\_{i} + 0 = a\_{i}$ Therefore, for a string $latex \\textbf{a} = a\_{1}..a\_{n}$, the identity element is $latex \\textbf{e} = e\_{1}...e\_{n}$, where, $latex e\_{i} = 0 , \\forall i \\in \\{1, n\\}$ Therefore, Binary Error Addition across $latex \\Sigma^{\*}$ has an Identity Element $latex \\textbf{e} = \\textbf{0}$ of length 'n'. 3) Inverse Element: We will show that $latex \\exists \\textbf{inv(a)} \\in \\Sigma^{\*} , \\forall \\textbf{a} \\in \\Sigma^{\*} , \\ni , \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{inv(a)} = \\textbf{e} $ Now, for any string of length 'n' , we notice by the definition of Binary Error Addition: if $latex a\_{i} = 1$ for $latex i \\in \\{1, n\\}$, we have that $latex a\_{i} + 1 = 0$ else if $latex a\_{i} = 0$ for $latex i \\in \\{1, n\\}$, we have that $latex a\_{i} + 0 = 0$ Therefore, for a string $latex \\textbf{a} = a\_{1}..a\_{n} $, the inverse element is $latex \\textbf{inv(a)} = c\_{1}...c\_{n}$, where $latex c\_{i} = 1$, if $latex a\_{i} = 1$ ,else $latex c\_{i} = 0$ Clearly, the inverse of $latex \\textbf{e}$ is the identity element itself. Therefore, Binary Error Addition across $latex \\Sigma^{\*}$ has an Inverse Element $latex \\textbf{inv(a)} = \\textbf{a} $. (Which is fairly intuitive) This is sufficient to show that $latex &lt;\\Sigma^{\*} , e(+) &gt; $ is a group. However, we will also show commutativity, implying that this is not just any group, but more specifically, it is an $latex \\textbf{Abelian Group}$. 4) Commutativity:  We will show that $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{b} + \\textbf{a} $ Now, we can show this very easily by first showing the commutativity of single length strings, as we did for associativity, and then just extend it to strings of an arbitrary length. Using the definition of Binary Error Addition: 1 + 0 = 1 = 0 + 1 0 + 0 = 0 = 0 + 0 1 + 1 = 0 = 1 + 1 0 + 1 = 1 = 1 + 0 Using the above result, we see that for, $latex \\textbf{a} = a\_{1} , \\textbf{b} = b\_{1}$ and $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = a\_{1} + b\_{1} = b\_{1} + a\_{1}$, using our table above. So, extending to arbitrary strings of length 'n', we have that: $latex \\textbf{a} = a\_{1}...a\_{n} , \\textbf{b} = b\_{1}...b\_{n}$, then, $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = a\_{i} + b\_{i} , \\forall i \\in \\{1, n\\}$ Now, using the above single-length commutativity, $latex a\_{i} + b\_{i} = b\_{i} + a\_{i} , \\forall i \\in \\{1, n\\}$, which implies that: $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{b} + \\textbf{a} $ Therefore, Binary Error Addition across $latex \\Sigma^{\*}$ is commutative. The last 2 properties we prove are not only important for the purposes of proof, but will form the backbone of the next proof that is related to the Maximum-Likelihood Model of Decoding Binary Strings using the Group Operation of Binary Error Addition. 5) Inverse Addition Commutativity: We will show that $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{a} - \\textbf{b}$, where, $latex \\textbf{a} - \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{a} + (- \\textbf{b})$ Let us add $latex \\textbf{b}$ to both sides of the equation. This gives us: $latex \\textbf{a} + 2 \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{e}$ (because, $latex \\textbf{b} + (- \\textbf{b}) = \\textbf{e}$) This implies that: $latex \\textbf{a} + 2 \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{a}$ (because $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{e} = \\textbf{a}$) So, we have that, finally: $latex 2 \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{e} = \\textbf{0}$ Now, this, though counterintuitive, makes sense. In the realm of Binary Error Addition, making the same error twice and comparing two same errors, leads to the identity element. And the reason for this is that, duplicating a signal results in zero error! So $latex 2 \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{b} + \\textbf{b} = b\_{i} + b\_{i}$, $latex \\forall i \\in \\{1, n\\}$ Now, by the definition of Binary Error Addition, 1 + 1= 0, and 0 + 0 = 0, therefore, as the two strings are similar, their comparison leads to the identity element, which is just a string of zeroes! 6) Retrieval of Information using Binary Error Addition: If $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{c}$, then, $latex \\textbf{a} = \\textbf{b} + \\textbf{c}$ In order to prove this, we simply use the proof regarding Inverse Addition Commutativity: $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{c}$ So, we now add $latex (- \\textbf{b})$ to both sides: $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b} - \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{c} - \\textbf{b}$ This gives us, using the inverse element addition and Inverse Addition Commutativity: $latex \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{e} = \\textbf{c} + \\textbf{b}$ $latex \\textbf{a} = \\textbf{c} + \\textbf{b}$ (Using the addition of identity element) &lt;span style="line-height:1.5;"&gt;$latex \\textbf{a} = \\textbf{b} + \\textbf{c}$ (Using Commutativity)&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, proposition 6) is proved. Notice that this may seem bizarre but all it is really saying that if 'a' is the original error string that gives the difference between strings 'b' and 'c' by putting 1s where they differ, then given 'c', we can add 'b' to it and obtain 'a', as where the error string and 'c' differ, we will obtain a '1', while where they are similar, we will obtain a '0', giving us 'a' again. Therefore, Proposition 1) through 6) hold true. QED Reference: 1) Problem F. Groups in Binary Code, Problems 1 - 7, Pages 32-34, A Book of Abstract Algebra, Charles C.

Proof 4: For Binary Strings of length 'n', the upper bound on the number of errors in a string that can be decoded correctly is (m - 1)/2, where 'm' = min(distance) between two Binary Strings
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/proof-4-for-binary-strings-of-length-n-the-upper-bound-on-the-number-of-errors-in-a-string-that-can-be-decoded-is-m-12-where-m-mindistance-between-two-binary-strings/ Wed, 27 May 2015 00:11:44 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=112 This proof will rely on the results of associativity and commutativity of Binary Error Addition obtained from Proof Number 3. The idea behind this proof is to show the upper bound on the number of bits one can make errors on while transmitting a Binary String, and still use heuristics obtained from the Binary Error Addition operation to retrieve to retrieve the exact original string that was being sent. (Binary Error Addition = $latex \\oplus$) Background: $latex \\textbf{Maximum-Likelihood Decoding}$ - Binary Strings of length 'n' are represented: $latex B^{n} = \\{ w : |w| = n , w \\in \\Sigma^{\*} \\} $ - A set of Binary Strings of some length: $latex C\_{n} \\subseteq B^{n} , \\textbf{Note}$ : I have merely chosen the notation to be such that the index of C is the same as the length of strings we are looking at for convenience. - Weight($latex \\textbf{a} $) = $latex \\Sigma \\epsilon\_{i} $, where, $latex \\epsilon\_{i} = 0$ if $latex a\_{i} = b\_{i}$ , and $latex \\epsilon\_{i} = 1$ if $latex a\_{i} \\neq b\_{i}$ , $latex \\textbf{Note}$ : This is an ordinary Sum, NOT a Binary error Sum. Basically, the weight of a string is the number of 1's in the string. - Distance($latex \\textbf{a} , \\textbf{b}$) = d($latex \\textbf{a} , \\textbf{b}$) = weight($latex ( \\textbf{a} \\oplus \\textbf{b} ) $) , $latex \\textbf{Note}$ : Distance just measures the number of alphabets that are different in the string - In constructing the Code, for a Code $latex C\_{n}$ , we have 'm' bits, where, m &lt; n, such that, these bits are called the $latex \\textbf{Information Bits}$ and the remaining 'n - m' bits are called $latex \\textbf{redundancy bits}$ : Usually, every permutation for the information bits is covered, and the redundancy bits are generating using parity check equations. Goal: Prove that, given $latex C\_{n} \\subset B^{n}$, if we have a transmitted string $latex \\textbf{x} \\in B^{n} , \\ni , |error| \\leq (m - 1)/2$, then, $latex \\textbf{x}$ can be traced to its original string in $latex C\_{n}$, where $latex d\_{min}( \\textbf{a} , \\textbf{b} )$ = m, $latex \\forall \\textbf{a} , \\textbf{b} \\in C\_{n}$ Assumption: The most relevant string is the closest one. Therefore, given a string $latex \\textbf{x}$, the original string is the one that has least distance from $latex \\textbf{x}$ and belongs to $latex C\_{n}$ Proof: We will show two statements that will allow us to prove the original statement: 1) Given a string $latex \\textbf{x} \\in B^{n}$, we can detect errors in a string, iff, |errors| &lt; (m - 1), where, m = $latex d\_{min}( \\textbf{a} , \\textbf{b} )$ , $latex \\forall \\textbf{b} , \\textbf{c} \\in C\_{n}$ - Suppose we assume that $latex \\exists \\textbf{x} , \\ni , |error| = m$ and the original string can be recovered. Now, we will use the properties of binary error addition to show that given that |error| = m, we can have that $latex \\textbf{x} \\in C\_{n}$ and that would not let us know that an error has been made. By the definition of distance, if |error| = m, then, $latex \\exists \\textbf{b} \\in C\_{n} , \\ni , \\textbf{x} + \\textbf{b} = \\textbf{c}$ ,where, weight($latex \\textbf{c} $) = m. This simply follows from the definition of distance. As we know that the weight of this new string is m, then, there can exist a string $latex \\textbf{c} \\in C\_{n} , \\ni , \\textbf{c} = \\textbf{x}$ because they have the same weight. While this may not always happen, because the same weight can be achieved through multiple configurations, it is certainly possible, and therefore, |error| = m implies that the string $latex \\textbf{x}$ can be confused for some string in $latex C\_{n}$ 2) We define a $latex \\textbf{Sphere of Radius k}$ around a string $latex \\textbf{a} \\in B^{n}$ as follows: $latex S\_{k}( \\textbf{a} ) = \\{ \\textbf{x} : d( \\textbf{a}, \\textbf{x} ) \\leq k\\}$ We will show that the maximum value that 'k' can have such that they have no strings in common, and therefore, no ambiguity in decoding an unknown string $latex \\textbf{x}$ is k = (m - 1)/2 So, we will show that $latex S\_{k} ( \\textbf{a} ) \\cap S\_{k} ( \\textbf{b} ) = \\phi$ , iff, k &lt;= (m - 1)/2 We know that, by definition, $latex d\_{min}( \\textbf{a} , \\textbf{b} ) = m$ If we assume that $latex S\_{k} ( \\textbf{a} ) \\cap S\_{k} ( \\textbf{b} ) = \\{ \\textbf{x} \\} $ , then: $latex d( \\textbf{x} , \\textbf{a} ) = r\_{1} \\leq k $ and $latex d( \\textbf{x} , \\textbf{b} ) = r\_{2} \\leq k $ As the distance between two strings is the weight of the error between them, and Binary Error Addition is commutative, $latex d( \\textbf{x} , \\textbf{a} ) = d( \\textbf{a} , \\textbf{x} )$ Therefore, we have that: $latex d( \\textbf{a} , \\textbf{b} ) = d( \\textbf{a}, \\textbf{x} ) + d( \\textbf{x}, \\textbf{b} ) = d( \\textbf{x}, \\textbf{a} ) + d( \\textbf{x} , \\textbf{b} ) \\geq m$ So, as the distance between two strings has to belong to positive integers, and the minimum distance is m, the sum of the greatest distance from each of the strings in $latex C\_{n}$ must be bounded. So, we have: $latex r\_{1} + r\_{2} \\leq k + k \\geq m$ $latex r\_{1} + r\_{2} \\leq 2k \\geq m$ $latex k \\geq m/2 $ and we need k to be an integer: the minimum choice that allows us to do this is k = m/2 However, if we fix k = 1/2(m - 1), we see that the inequality is violated, giving us an obvious contradiction with the minimum possible distance, and leading us to conclude that this is the maximum possible value of 'k' at which an empty set intersection occurs. Therefore, the maximum value of 'k' that we can choose so that $latex S\_{k} ( \\textbf{a} ) \\cap S\_{k} ( \\textbf{b} ) = \\phi$ is k = (m - 1)/2 Using 1) and 2), we can easily see that if $latex |error| \\leq (m - 1)/2$ for some string $latex \\textbf{x}$, then, there can exist at most one sphere of radius (m - 1)/2, such that, $latex d( \\textbf{x} , \\textbf{a} ) \\leq (m - 1)/2$, for some $latex \\textbf{a} \\in C\_{n}$ Therefore, the string can be uniquely decoded. However, if |error| &gt; (m - 1)/2 , we see that it is possible for two sphere to intersect. Therefore, the upper bound on the number of errors in a string of length 'n' that can be decoded correctly is (m - 1)/2, where 'm' = min(distance) between two Binary Strings.

Proof 5: Properties of Finite Groups & Finite Abelian Groups
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/05/29/proof-5-properties-of-finite-groups-finite-abelian-groups/ Fri, 29 May 2015 23:30:11 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=149 Notation: $latex S = \\{ x \\in G : x \\neq x^{-1} \\} $ , where G is a set over which some arbitrary operation forms a group. Note : An operation is merely represented as a concatenation, and an operation over an element $latex a \\in G$ repeated 'n' times is represented as $latex a^{n}$ In this proof, we will show 3 general properties regarding Groups of a finite Order (i.e., G, such that, |G| = n): 1) For any finite Group G, the number of elements not equal to their own inverse is an even number 2) The number of elements in G, such that, the element is its own inverse is odd or even, depending on the order of G 3) If |G| is even, then, there is at least one element $latex x \\in G$, such that, $latex x \\neq e$ and $latex x = x^{-1}$ We will further show that, if $latex G = \\{ e, a\_{1}, a\_{2},..a\_{n} \\}$ is an Abelian Group of finite order, then: 4) $latex (a\_{1}a\_{2}...a\_{n})^{2} = e$ 5) If there is no element  $latex x \\neq e$ in G, such that, $latex x = x^{-1}$, then, $latex a\_{1}a\_{2}...a\_{n} = e$ 6) If there is exactly element $latex x\\neq e$ in G, such that, $latex x = x^{-1}$, then, $latex (a\_{1}a\_{2}...a\_{n})^{2} = e$ Proof: 1) Let, |G| = n. Now, there are 2 kinds of elements in a group. One belong to $latex S \\subset G$, and the other to $latex G - S$ Note :$latex e \\in (G - S)$ Now, as by the property of Groups, every element in a group must have its inverse, $latex \\forall x \\in (G - S) , x = x^{-1}$, therefore, all elements $latex x \\in G$ must be in pairs, such that, $latex \\forall x \\in G , \\exists y \\in G$ and $latex xy = e$ Now, let us create pairs $latex \\forall (x, x^{-1}) \\in G$. There will exists |pairs|, such that, $latex S = \\{ (x, x^{-1}), (y, y^{-1}), ... , (z, z^{-1}) \\} , \\forall (x\_{i} , x\_{j}) \\in G$. This tells us that, making sure that we don't count twice for each permutation, |S| = 2|pairs|, where, $latex |pairs| \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ , which means that |S| = even, by definition of even numbers Therefore, we see that |S| = number of elements not equal to their own inverse = Even. 2) Let, |G| = n. We will treat this case-by-case, first assuming that n = even, and then that n = odd: Case 1: |G| =n , such that, $latex n = 2k, where, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ So, as showed in 1), |S| = 2|pairs|, where, $latex |pairs| \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ So, we have that $latex |G - S| = |G| - |S| $  (because, $latex S \\subset G$) So, $latex |G - S| = 2k - 2|pairs| = 2(k - |pairs|) = 2c $, for some $latex c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ Therefore, |G - S| = even, if |G| = even Note: |G - S| $latex \\neq $ 0, because, $latex \\forall G , \\exists, e \\in G $ such that $latex e = e^{-1} $. So, |G - S| &gt;= 2. Case 2: |G| = n, such that, $latex n = 2k + 1, where, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ So, we have that $latex |G -S| = |G| - |S| = 2k + 1 - 2|pairs| = 2(k - |pairs|) + 1 = 2c + 1$, for some $latex c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ Therefore,$latex |G - S| = odd$, if $latex |G| = odd $ 3) We will show, |G| = 2k, for some $latex k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, then, $latex \\exists x \\in G$ such that $latex x \\neq e$ and $latex x = x^{-1} $ Let, |G| = 2k + 1, for some k &gt;= 1, as this is the smallest non-trivial cardinality possible. Now, using 1), |S| = 2|pairs| So, |G - S| = 2c, for some c = (k - |pairs|) By definition, as $latex x = x^{-1}$, x must be in (G - S). Now, as |G - S| &gt; 0, as at least the identity element belongs to it, we will let |G - S| = b, for some $latex b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ So, we have that, $latex |G - S| + |S| = |G| $ So, $latex b + 2|pairs| = 2k$ Therefore, $latex b = 2(k - |pairs|) \\geq 1$ (because, $latex k \\neq |pairs|$). Now, as there is one identity element in (G - S), and |G -S| &gt; 1, we have that, there must exists some x in G, such that, $latex x = x^{-1}$ QED We will now assume further that the group is Abelian, that is, $latex \\forall a, b \\in G , ab = ba$ 4) To show this property, we must realize that, for any element $latex a \\in G$, either, $latex a \\in S$ or $latex a \\in (G - S)$. Therefore, for $latex (a\_{1}a\_{2}...a\_{n})^{2} = (a\_{1}a\_{2}...a\_{n})(a\_{1}a\_{2}...a\_{n}) = a\_{1}a\_{2}...a\_{n}a\_{a}a\_{2}...a\_{n}$ Now, we must realize that, if $latex a\_{i} \\in S$, then, $latex \\exists a\_{j} \\in S$, such that $latex a\_{i} \\neq a\_{j}$ and $latex a\_{i}a\_{j} = e$ Now, because of commutativity, we can 'swap' the inverse element $latex a\_{j}$ for a particular element $latex a\_{i}$ with its predecessor. So, suppose we have, $latex a\_{i} = a\_{1}$, then, $latex a\_{1}....a\_{j-1}a\_{j}..a\_{n}$ is the sequence we have. We first swap $latex a\_{j - 1}$ with$latex a\_{j} $ using commutativity. We keep doing it till we have $latex a = a\_{1}a\_{j}a\_{2}....a\_{j-1}...a\_{n}$ Now, courtesy the inverse element law, $latex a\_{1}a\_{j} = e$ and we are left with $latex a\_{2}..a\_{j-1}a\_{j+1}..a\_{n}$ We do this $latex \\forall a\_{i} \\in S$, and this is at max, a $latex O(n^{2})$ operation. So, for $latex (a\_{1}...a\_{n})^{2}$, we are left with: $latex (a\_{1}...a\_{n})^{2} = (a\_{i}..a\_{m}a\_{i}...a\_{m})$, where all $latex a\_{i} \\in S$ have been cancelled with their respective inverses. Therefore, the current expression only contains $latex a\_{i} \\in (G - S)$, which means that all the elements are their own inverse. Now, as all $latex a\_{i} \\in (G - S)$ appear in the above term TWICE, because of squaring, it can be rearranged using commutativity (again in $latex O(m - k)^{2}$ operations), such that, $latex (a\_{1}..a\_{n})^{2} = a\_{i}a\_{i}a\_{k}a\_{k}....a\_{m}a\_{m} = ee...e = e$ Therefore, we have that, $latex (a\_{1}...a\_{n})^{2} = e$ QED 5) If, $latex \\nexists x \\in (G - S)$, as $latex x \\neq x^{-1}, \\forall x \\in G$, then $latex S = G$, and therefore, we can see, using the technique in 4) that, $latex a\_{1}...a\_{n}$ can be rearranged using commutativity in $latex O(n^{2})$ operations to make inverse elements adjacent and cancel out. So, we will have: $latex a\_{1}..a\_{n} = a\_{1}(a\_{1})^{-1}a\_{2}(a\_{2})^{-1}...a\_{n/2}(a\_{n/2})^{-1}$ after $latex O(n^{2})$ moves. So: $latex a\_{1}....a\_{n} = ee...e = e$ Therefore, we have that $latex a\_{1}..a\_{n} = e$ QED 6) If, $latex \\exists x$, such that, $latex x = x^{-1}$ , and there is only one such element, then, |G - S| = 2, and as the identity element must belong to a group, and the inverse of the identity element is itself, we can see that the only elements in (G - S) are $latex e$ and $latex x$. Therefore, we see that, all elements in S will cancel out using commutativity operations after $latex O(n^{2})$ operation. Firstly, $latex a\_{1}...a\_{n} = x$. Therefore, we have that $latex (a\_{1}...a\_{n})^{2} = xx = xx^{-1} = e$ QED Reference: 1) Problem E.

Proof 6: The complement of a Disconnected Graph is a Connected Graph
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/proof-6-the-complement-of-a-disconnected-graph-is-a-connected-graph/ Wed, 17 Jun 2015 17:04:34 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=168 Background : This is a fairly elementary proof in Introductory Graph Theory. Having written some proofs in the realm of Abstract Algebra, I wanted to give one on the side that is perhaps a little more practical. The terminology I am introducing will be useful for further proofs, therefore, please read it here if you plan on reading any future proofs of Graph Theory on my page. Graph - A graph is donated as - $latex G = (V, E)$, where $latex V = \\{v\_{1},v\_{2},...,v\_{n}\\}$ is the set of all vertices, and $latex E = \\{e\_{1}, e\_{2},....,e\_{m}\\}$ is the set of edges, where $latex e\_{i} = uv$, for some $latex u, v \\in V$ Path - A path in a graph is a set of ordered vertices, such that the adjacent vertices in the set are connected by an edge, and no 2 vertices are the same. More formally, $latex P(v\_{0} - v\_{k}) = \\{v\_{0}, v\_{1},...,v\_{k} \\} \\ni , v\_{i}v\_{i + 1} \\in E(G) , \\forall , v\_{i} , v\_{i + 1} \\in P$ and $latex v\_{i} \\neq v\_{j}$ Distance - The distance between two nodes u, v in a graph G is the shortest path between them Connected Component - A connected component $latex k(G)$ of a graph G is the largest possible subgraph of a graph G, $latex \\ni , \\forall u, v \\in k(G), \\exists P(u - v)$ Complement - The complement of a graph G is $latex \\tilde{G} , \\ni , V(G) = V(\\tilde{G})$ and $latex E(\\tilde{G}) = \\{v\_{i}v\_{j} : iff v\_{i}v\_{j} \\notin E(G) \\} $ Proof: To prove the statement, we need to realize 2 things, if G is a disconnected graph, then $latex k(G) &gt; 1$, i.e., it has more than 1 connected component. Therefore, by definition, $latex \\exists u, v \\in V(G), \\ni , \\nexists P(u - v) in G$. This implies, in G, there are 2 kinds of vertices. Either those that belong to the same connected component of G, or those that are in different components. Therefore, we will prove in 2 cases. In the first case, we will show that connected vertices in the same component are still connected in the complement Graph, and that initially unconnected vertices in separate components are connected. The latter is trivial, for it is by definition, so let us start with that one. Case 1: $latex u, v \\in G, \\ni , u \\in G\_{1}$ and $latex v \\in G\_{2}$, where, $latex G\_{1} \\neq G\_{2} , G\_{1} , G\_{2} \\subset G$ and $latex G\_{1} , G\_{2}$ are connected. As, by definition of the disconnected nature of G, and the connected components, $latex P(u - v)$ does not exist in G. Therefore, by definition of $latex \\tilde{G}, P(u - v) = uv , \\ni, uv \\in E(\\tilde{G})$ exists in $latex \\tilde{G}$ Therefore, we see that for all nodes that belong to different connected components, an edge now connects them in $latex \\tilde{G}$ Case 2: $latex u, v \\in G, \\ni , u, v \\in G\_{1}$, where, $latex G\_{1} \\subset G $ and $latex G\_{1}$ is a connected component. Now, as previously, in G, $latex \\exists uv \\in E(G)$, we have that $latex uv \\notin E(\\tilde{G})$ . However, in a different connected component (there must exist at least one more, as we know that $latex k(G) &gt; 1$), $latex \\exists w \\in G\_{2} , \\ni , uw, vw \\in E(\\tilde{G})$ This follows simply from the definition. As $latex uw, vw \\notin E(G)$, they must belong to $latex E(\\tilde{G})$ Now, as u, v are adjacent to a common vertex, we can build a path of ordered vertices, such that, there will be a path from u to v. More formally: $latex uw, vw \\notin E(G)$ implies $latex uw, vw \\in E(\\tilde{G})$ which implies $latex \\exists P(u - v) = {u, w, v}$ Clearly, this holds for all vertices in a connected component, as they will be connected from a common vertex connected to them individually in another connected component. Therefore, $latex k(\\tilde{G}) = 1$ As, we have that $latex \\forall u, v \\in V(G), \\ni , uv \\notin E(G)$ and G is not connected , $latex \\exists uv \\in E(\\tilde{G})$, we have that $latex \\tilde{G}$ is a connected graph. QED A simple proof. It will motivate more complicated Graph Theoretic proofs in the future.

Proof 7: Given a Graph G, such that, Order(G) &gt;= 5, then, at most G or comp(G) are Bi-Partite, but not both.
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/06/28/proof-7-given-a-graph-g-such-that-orderg-5-then-at-most-g-or-compg-are-bi-partite-but-not-both/ Sun, 28 Jun 2015 01:38:22 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=183 Background: This is a bit of a tedious proof, and while intuitively one can understand how to go about it, we will need to formalize a few other statements and prove them before we can do this proof. I shall provide definitions of the term Bipartite (= 2-Partite), and also prove the theorems we will need to prove this statement. 1) Bi-Partite (2-Partite) - A graph $latex G = (V, E)$ is 2-partite iff $latex \\exists U, W \\subset V(G) \\ni , U \\cap W = \\phi$ and $latex U \\cup W = V(G)$ and, furthermore, $latex E(G) = \\{ uv : u \\in U and v \\in W\\}$ Informally, this is a partitioning of a graph into two non-intersecting subset of vertices, such that, no 2 vertices in the same subset are adjacent. a) In the event that we have a disconnected graph, i.e., $latex G = (V,E), \\ni , k(G) \\textgreater 1$ , it can only be 2-partite if all of its connected components are 2-partite. Proof - This is fairly easy to see. We see that if $latex \\exists CC(G), \\ni , CC(G) \\neq 2-partite$, then, G itself can never be 2-partite, because, $latex G = CC\_{1} \\cup CC\_{2} \\cup ... \\cup CC\_{n}$ , and so, as $latex \\nexists uv \\in E(G)$ , for some u in the non-bipartite component, and v in some bipartite component$ , we cannot split those vertices into any 2 existing subsets designed for the other Connected Components, as by doing so, we will be forced to put at least 2 vertices connected by an edge in one of those subsets. b) Given $latex G = (V, E)$ , then, G = 2-partite, iff, $latex \\nexists C\_{odd} \\subset G$. Proof - Basically, this statement says that in order for any graph to be Bi-partite, none of its possible subgraphs can be an odd cycle. And, of course, vice-versa. We will show 2 cases: 1) Given there is an odd cycle subgraph in a graph, it is not 2-partite. 2) Given a graph is 2-partite, there is no odd-cycle in it. 1) We know that $latex \\exists C\_{odd} \\subset V(G)$. Therefore, in order to the Graph G, we will also need to make sure that we can partition this cycle. In order to partition the vertices, we will manually assign vertices that are adjacent to each other to each other opposing partition sets. That is, suppose, $latex \\exists U, W \\subset V , \\ni , $ vertices $latex v \\in C\_{odd}$ are put into U and W alternatingly if they are adjacent. So, let $latex C\_{odd} = (V\_{odd}, E^{'})$ where $latex V\_{odd} = (v\_{1}, v\_{2}, ... , v\_{2k + 1})$ for some $latex k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ Now, let us start by assigning $latex v\_{1} \\in U$ and $latex v\_{2} \\in W$ and so on. We see then, that, $latex v\_{odd} \\in U$, and $latex v\_{even} \\in W$. Therefore, $latex v\_{2k + 1} \\in U$, and so is $latex v\_{1} \\in U$. However, as we have a Cycle, we know that, $latex v\_{2k + 1}v\_{1} \\in E(G)$. Therefore, we have that 2 adjacent vertices belong to the same subset on partition, and there is no other way of partitioning. This implies that if we have an odd cycle, there exists no way to partition the Graph in a Bipartite manner. 2) Given a 2-partite graph. if there exists an odd cycle in it, we know that $latex v\_{2k + 1}$ and  $latex v\_{1}$ are not in the same set. Then, we have that, as there is, at minimum, 1 cross edge between two vertices in U, W (not counting the edges due to the cycle), then, we have that: $latex \\sum$ $latex deg(v)$ = $latex 2(2k + 1)$ = $latex 4k + 3$ = $latex (4k + 2) + 1$, which means that the sum of degrees is odd, and this violates the fundamental theorem of Graph Theory, that the sum of all edges is equivalent to an even number. The very fact that this possibility exists implies that we cannot have a 2-partite graph with an odd cycle. Now, we shall use the 2 facts above to show our main claim: The only case we really need to show that given a Graph $latex G = (V, E) , \\ni , k(G) = 1$ and $latex G = 2-partite$ , $latex \\overline{G} \\neq 2-partite$. Now, we have that, as G is 2-partite by definition, $latex \\nexists C\_{odd} \\in V(G)$ . Therefore, all we need to show that in $latex \\overline{G}$ , $latex \\exists C\_{odd} \\in $ $latex V(\\overline{G})$. This would imply that $latex \\overline{G} $ is not 2-partite. So, we now have to show the existence of $latex C\_{odd}$ for graphs G that have even cycles or are acyclic. Let us prove these cases: 1) $latex G = (V, E) \\ni , \\exists C\_{even} \\in V(G) $ . We will then show that $latex \\exists K\_{odd} \\subset \\overline{C\_{even}} $ , where, $latex \\overline{C\_{even}} \\in \\overline{G}$ . Now, we know that there must be at-least 6 vertices (for the case of 4 vertices in the cycle, there must exist at-least 1vertex not in the cycle, and connected to some vertex in the cycle, leading to a 3-cycle in the negated graph), and let us donate the number of edges in $latex C\_{even}$ as $latex e$. In $latex C\_{even}$ , we see that $latex |E(\\overline{C\_{even}})|$ = $latex e(e - 1)/2 - (e)$ = $latex e^{2}/2 - 3e/2$. We notice that this number is even and greater than  $latex (e - 1)$ itself. Therefore, we see that, as there must exist for some vertex $latex v \\in V(G)$ , at least 2 vertices $latex u, w \\in V(G) , \\ni , (vu , vw, uw) \\notin E(G) $. We have that, in $latex \\overline{G} $ , $latex (vw, uw, uw) \\in E(\\overline{G}) $, implying that there exists a 3 cycle. Now, in order for 3 such vertices to exist, they need to be, at minimum, at alternating distances from each other, that is, $latex d\_{min} (v, w) = 2$ , $latex \\forall v \\in C\_{odd} \\subset \\overline{C\_{even}}$. As the smallest odd cycle is a 3-cycle, we need a 6-cycle complement to always create a 3-cycle as one of its subgraphs, showing the inability to have it exhibit the property of being 2-partite. Therefore, as $latex (vw, uw, uw) \\in E(\\overline{G}) $, we have that, $latex C\_{odd} = (\\{u, v, w\\} , \\{uv , vw, uw\\}) \\subset \\overline{G}$ , and therefore, $latex \\overline{G} \\neq $ 2-partite. 2) In the event that we have $latex G = (V,E) \\ni , G$ = Acyclic Graph. Now, as $latex |E(G)| \\leq (n - 1)$, where, $latex n = |V(G)| $ ,$latex \\exists (v\_{1}, v\_{2}) \\in V(G) , \\ni , deg(v\_{1})$ = $latex deg(v\_{2})$ = 1. As $latex \\sum$ $latex deg(v) = 2(n - 1) $ , $latex \\forall v \\in V(G)$ , we see that, provided $latex k(G) = 1$, $latex \\exists (v\_{1} , v\_{2}), \\ni , deg(v\_{1}) = deg(v\_{2}) = 1$ . Now, as this is the case, given a graph of atleast 5 vertices, there exists at least 1 vertex $latex w , \\ni , (v\_{1}w , v\_{2}w) \\notin E(G)$. Then, we have that, as, $latex deg(v\_{1}) = deg(v\_{2}) = 1$ and $latex |V(G)| \\geq 5 $ , $latex v\_{1}v\_{2} \\notin E(G)$. Finally, we see that $latex (v\_{1}v\_{2} , v\_{1}w, v\_{2}w) \\in E(\\overline{G})$ , implying that $latex \\exists (3\_{-}cycle) \\subset \\overline{G}$. Therefore, we see that $latex \\overline{G} \\neq$ 2-partite. Therefore, our original claim is proved. QED.

Algorithm 1 : Create the 2-partite sets for a graph G = (V, E) , such that, for all u, v in G, |P(u -&gt; v)| = Odd, or |P(u -&gt; v) | = Even

Assumptions: 1) That we have access to standard Data Structures (Graph, Queue) with optimal implementation. 2) Edges in the Graph carry a uniform weight. 3) G is 2-partite, as shown from Proof 8 previously. 4) Djikstra's Algorithm, modified, such that, at every node, it's path from the start node is stored, and Djikstra returns an Array which contains a path from the start node to the current node, and whether it is odd or even. 5) Each node v of the Graph G is marked with a label. The nodes are visited in serial order from the BFS Tree that is inherited from the BFS Traversal. We can assume that the adjacency list of the Graph respects this ordering. Basically, we go from $latex v\_{1} \\dashrightarrow v\_{2} \\dashrightarrow v\_{3}$ and so on during a Traversal. Algorithm: &lt;strong&gt;def constructUandW: -      &lt;/strong&gt;Pick $latex v \\in V(G)$ -      $latex v \\dashrightarrow visited$ -      pathsArray\[\] = Djikstra (G, v) -      U = \[\] -      W = \[\] -      U.add(v) -     while |U| + |W| &lt; |V(G)|: -          $latex \\hspace{16 mm} \\forall $ p = $latex (v, v\_{1}, ... , v\_{i}) \\in $ pathsArray\[\]: -          if |p| = odd: -                $latex \\hspace{16 mm}$ W.add($latex v\_{i}$) -          else: -                $latex \\hspace{8 mm} $ U.add($latex v\_{i}$) Computational Complexity : $latex O(m + n(logn))$ -&gt; Run-Time of Djikstra's Algorithm. BFS is Linear-Time, i.e., $latex O(m + n$. Therefore, our Algorithm runs in ~ $latex O(m + n(logn))$ time. Proof of Correctness: In a graph G = (V, E), where we have assumed that $latex \\kappa (G) $ =$latex 1$ . (Adding a disconnected component doesn't matter, because as long as every component is bi=partite, the whole graph is bi-partite). So, now, we see that, $latex \\forall v\_{i} , v\_{j} \\in V(G)$ , $latex \\exists p(u - v)$ . We must understand that the minimum number of edges in the graph are $latex |E(G)| = |V(G) - 1| $. Therefore, we have that, every vertex v is adjacent to atleast some other vertex v' in the Graph G. So, we see that if we remove one edge from all Even cycles (if our Graph has cycles), then we get a Linked List, which can be made into a Bi-Partite Graph easily. So, now, all we need to prove is that no edge removed from an Even Cycle is between two vertices in the same subset of V. Let us assume that $latex \\exists u\_{i} , u\_{j} \\in U , \\ni , u\_{i}u\_{j} \\in E(G)$ . This would imply that during our BFS-like traversal we put two nodes in the queue on the same level, with the same distance to their parent (such that), they have one edge between them. This would imply the existence of a 3-cycle. That is, during the BFS traversal, on the same level, we have a cross edge. So, this implies, $latex \\exists C\_{3} \\subset G$. Clearly, as we know that G is 2-partite, this is not possible. Therefore, no 2 vertices in the same set in U or W are adjacent to each other.

Proof 8 : If we have G = (V, E), such that, for all u, v in V(G), |p(u-&gt;v)| = Even or |p(u-&gt;v)| = Odd, then, G is 2-Partite
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/proof-8-if-we-have-g-v-e-such-that-for-all-u-v-in-vg-pu-v-even-or-pu-v-odd-then-g-is-2-partite/ Tue, 11 Aug 2015 02:15:19 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=220 We need to understand exactly what is going on. Really, all we need to show that the Graph is 2-partite is show that there exists no Odd Cycle in the graph G. This can be shown rather simply. Given : $latex G = (V,E) , \\ni , \\forall u,v \\in V(G) , \\forall p(u-v) , |p(u-v)| = Even \\vee |p(u-v)| = Odd$ To Prove: $latex G = (V, E) $ is 2-partite. That is, $latex \\exists U, W \\subset V $,  $latex \\ni $ , $latex ( U \\cup W $ = $latex V ) $ $latex \\wedge $ $latex ( U \\cap W $= $latex \\phi ) $ Proof : Let us use Proof By Contradiction. Assume that: $latex \\exists C\_{odd} \\in G $ . Now, by definition, $latex \\forall v \\in C\_{odd} $ ,$latex \\exists v\_{i} , v\_{j} \\in C\_{odd} $ , $latex \\ni , ( v\_{i}v\_{j} \\in E(G) ) \\wedge ( p( v\_{i} - v\_{j} )$ exists . The specified path does not construct of the edge that joins $latex v\_{i} and v\_{j}$ , but rather the cycle around it. Now, as we have an Odd Cycle, we know that $latex |V\_{cycle}| = Odd $. Therefore, as $latex v\_{i} v\_{j}$ are adjacent, for the second path, the number of remaining vertices to traverse are $latex V(C\_{odd}) - \\{v\_{i} , v\_{j} \\}$ . This is an odd number of vertices. Therefore, the number of edges between this acyclic path is $latex | V(C\_{odd}) - \\{ v\_{i} , v\_{j} \\} | - 1$ Clearly, this is an even number, as 1 subtracted from any odd number yields an even number. Therefore, we see that :  $latex , \\exists P\_{1}(v\_{i} - v\_{j}) \\wedge P\_{2}( v\_{i} - v\_{j} )$ , where: $latex |P\_{1}(v\_{i} - v\_{j})| = |v\_{i}v\_{j}| = 1$ and $latex |P\_{2}(v\_{i} - v\_{j})|$ = $latex | V(C\_{odd}) - \\{ v\_{i} , v\_{j} \\} | - 1 $ = $latex Even$ Clearly, this is a violation, as no two nodes with paths between them can have both even and odd paths. Therefore, our assumption stands invalidated. Therefore, if we have $latex G = (V,E) , \\ni , \\forall u,v \\in V(G) , \\forall p(u-v) , |p(u-v)| = Even \\vee |p(u-v)| = Odd$ , $latex G = (V, E)$ is 2-partite. We can even go a bit further for this problem and even imagine what the sets U and W would be. Now, as 1 is an odd number, we can see that all adjacent vertices would have only odd paths between them. Therefore, we put all pairs of vertices with odd paths between them in opposite sets. We do the exact opposite for all pairs of vertices with even paths between them. As all pairs of vertices with odd paths are in cross sets, and no pairs of vertices with odd paths can have even paths, we will see that none of the vertices will allow for adjacency in between the sets. One can formalize this proof quite easily, but I'll just give a rough, intuitive formulation of what U and W would look like. So, $latex U \\subset V$ , $latex \\ni , \\forall u\_{i} $ , $latex u\_{j} \\in U $ , $latex |p(u\_{i} - u\_{j})| $ = $latex Even$ Similarly, $latex W \\subset V$ , $latex \\ni , \\forall v\_{i}$ , $latex v\_{j} \\in W $, $latex |p(v\_{i} - v\_{j})| $ = $latex Even$ So, all vertices that have paths that are odd in length are placed across each other, such that one of them is in U and the other in W. Now, all we need to show is that none of the vertices in the same set are adjacent, and that all odd paths can be reconstructed. Clearly, by definition, $latex 1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\_{odd}$ , therefore, all adjacent vertices are in cross-sets. For all paths between two vertices of length &gt; 1, and length = Odd, we will see that we will hop between sets, until we eventually end up on a node in a cross set. One can verify the correctness of this solution by simply enumerating all paths in the Graph using Djikstras on all nodes. The run time for that Algorithm would be : $latex O(nm + (nm)log(m))$ ~ $latex O(nmlog(m)) $ Therefore, this partition allows an easy construction of non-overlapping sets for 2-partitioning G. 220 2015-08-11 02:15:19 2015-08-11 02:15:19 open open proof-8-if-we-have-g-v-e-such-that-for-all-u-v-in-vg-pu-v-even-or-pu-v-odd-then-g-is-2-partite publish 0 0 post 0 Graph Theory \_edit\_last 87744808 geo\_public 0 \_publicize\_job\_id 13606344444

Proof 9: Given G = (V, E), such that G is r-regular and bi-partite, then |U| = |W|, where U, W are the 2-partite sets of G
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/08/29/proof-9-given-g-v-e-such-that-g-is-r-regular-and-bi-partite-then-u-w-where-u-w-are-the-2-partite-sets-of-g/ Sat, 29 Aug 2015 23:02:12 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=266 This proof requires, as a pre-requisite, the understanding of the concepts of Regular Graphs. I will introduce Regular Graphs and a Theorem concerning Regular Graphs in this section before I actually prove the statement. Definitions: 1) G = (V,E) is said to be r-regular, iff, $latex \\forall v \\in V(G) , deg(v) = r$. A r-regular graph G is denoted as $latex H\_{r, n}$ 2) As before, a Graph G = (V, E) is 2-partite, iff, $latex \\exists U, W \\subset V(G) , \\ni , U \\cap W = \\phi $ and $latex U \\cup W = V $ , where, $latex e \\in E(G)$ iff $latex e = (u\_{i}w\_{j})$ Proof: We are given that $latex G = (V, E) = H\_{r, n}$ , so, $latex \\forall u , w \\in U$ and $latex W , deg (u) = deg(w) = r $ The number of edges in this graph is $latex |E| = r(n)/2 $ We shall simply assume that U and W have an arbitrary number of nodes each. Let $latex |U| = k$ and $latex |W| = n - k$ We have that, in a partite graph, the number of edges from the vertices in U are equal to the number of edges from the vertices in W. If this is not the case, then, $latex \\exists e \\in E(G), \\ni , e = (u\_{i}, v) $ for some vertex $latex v \\notin V(G)$. This clearly is a contradiction to the basic structure of G. Therefore, given our assumption that $latex |U| = k$ and $latex |W| = (n - k)$ and that the sum of the edges in both sets must be equal, we have that: $latex \\sum deg(u)$ = $latex \\sum deg(w)$ where $latex u \\in U$ and $latex w \\in W$ Now, as this is a regular graph, all vertices have the same degree. Given that |U| = k, |W| = (n - k) , we have that: $latex \\sum\_{u \\in U} deg(u) = r(k)$ and that, $latex \\sum\_{w \\in W} deg(w) = r(n - k)$. Therefore, $latex rk = r(n - k) = rn - rk$ $latex 2rk = rn$ $latex k = n/2$ Therefore, we have that $latex |U| = k = n/2 $ and $latex |W| = (n - k) = n - n/2 = n/2 $ This implies that  $latex |U| = |W| = n/2 $ QED Reference: Problem 2.27, Page-43, A First Course in Graph Theory, Gary Chartrand &amp; Ping Zhang, Dover Books. 266 2015-08-29 23:02:12 2015-08-29 23:02:12 open open proof-9-given-g-v-e-such-that-g-is-r-regular-and-bi-partite-then-u-w-where-u-w-are-the-2-partite-sets-of-g publish 0 0 post 0 Graph Theory \_edit\_last 87744808 geo\_public 0 \_publicize\_job\_id 14231261855

Algorithm 2: Find the number of paths between two vertices u,v in a Graph G = (V,E)
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/algorithm-2-find-the-number-of-paths-between-two-vertices-uv-in-a-graph-g-ve/ Tue, 08 Sep 2015 02:44:13 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=277 This Algorithm will build on a new understanding of a way to look at Graphs. In particular, we will use the Adjacency Matrix and the Diameter of a Graph to build this Algorithm. The Computational Complexity of this Algorithm will be discussed once the pseudocode is presented. Pre-requisites : 1) Adjacency Matrix - The Adjacency Matrix $latex \\textbf{A}$ of a graph G = (V,E), with $latex |V(G)| = n$ is: -  $latex a\_{ij} = 1$ if $latex v\_{i}v\_{j} \\in E(G)$ - $latex a\_{ij} = 0$ otherwise 2) Diameter - The Diameter of a Graph G = (V, E) is $latex argmax(|p(v\_{i}-v\_{j})|) , \\forall v\_{i}, v\_{j} \\in V(G)$ Algorithm : The Algorithm is based off of 2 ideas: 1) The length of any path between any two vertices is less than the Diameter of a Graph. 2) In any Graph G = (V,E) , we have that , $latex (\\textbf{A})^{k} $ has $latex a\_{ij} = |p(v\_{i}-v\_{j})|$ of length 'k'. Proof of 2): We will use Induction. a) For k = 1, by definition, the Adjacency Matrix $latex \\textbf{A} $ tells us whether or not an edge exists between two vertices. In a Graph, and Edge is the only path of length-1. b) Inductive Hypothesis : Assume that, $latex \\forall k \\leq n$ for some $latex n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ , $latex (\\textbf{A})^{k}$ gives the number of all possible paths from a vertex $latex v\_{i}$ to another vertex $latex v\_{j}$ of length 'k'. c) For $latex n = k + 1$ , we have that : $latex (\\textbf{A})^{(k + 1)}$ = $latex (\\textbf{A})^{(k)}\\textbf{A}$. Now, by the Inductive Hypothesis, $latex \\forall a\_{ij} \\in (\\textbf{A})^{(k)}$ , $latex a\_{ij} = |p(v\_{i}-v\_{j})|$ Now, for any vertex, all paths that end at a vertex must come in from one of it's adjacent vertices. By definition of the Adjacency     Matrix and Matrix Multiplication, then: $latex \\sum (a\_{ij})^{(k + 1)} = (a\_{i(1)})^{k}a\_{(1)j} + .... + (a\_{i(n)})^{k}a\_{(n)j}$ By definition, for all adjacent vertices to $latex v\_{j}$ , $latex a\_{(i)j}$ = 1, $latex \\forall i \\in \[1, n\]$ Therefore, the paths from a vertex $latex v\_{i}$ to a vertex $latex v\_{j}$ of length (k + 1), are the sum of the paths of length (k), from vertex $latex v\_{i}$ to all the adjacent vertices of $latex v\_{j}$. Therefore, 2) is true. QED Pseudocode : - length = 0 - count = 0 - A = adjacencyMatrix - B = adjacencyMatrix - while (length =&lt; $latex diam\_{G}$):         // $latex O(diam\_{G})$ -      $latex \\hspace{16 mm} count += a\_{ij}$ -      $latex \\hspace{16 mm} (\\textbf{A})^{'}$ = $latex \\textbf{A}$\*$latex \\textbf{B}$     // $latex O(n^{3})$ -      $latex \\hspace{16 mm} length$ += 1 -       $latex \\hspace{16 mm}$ $latex \\textbf{A} $ = $latex (\\textbf{A})^{'}$ return count Now, we know that $latex diam\_{G} \\leq n$ and therefore, all paths of all possible lengths between $latex v\_{i}$ and $latex v\_{j}$ are summed up and return under the variable 'count'. Computational Complexity : $latex O(n^{3}(diam\_{G}))$ . Now, $latex diam\_{G}$ is between '1' and 'n'. Therefore, we will have that the computational complexity of our Algorithm will be bounded by : $latex \[O(n^{3}), O(n^{4})\]$. The $latex O(n^{3})$ comes from the Matrix Multiplication Algorithm, which can be reduced by using a Cache, or by distributing the task. However, for most purposes, the Algorithm is cubic in time. Space Complexity : $latex O(n^{2})$ . Here, the Squared Space Complexity arises because of the need to store the Adjacency Matrix in-memory. The proof of correctness for this Algorithm follows directly from 2). 277 2015-09-08 02:44:13 2015-09-08 02:44:13 open open algorithm-2-find-the-number-of-paths-between-two-vertices-uv-in-a-graph-g-ve publish 0 0 post 0 Algorithms Graph Theory \_edit\_last 87744808 geo\_public 0 \_publicize\_job\_id 14547293870

On battlefields, fallen heroes scream the glory of their heroism with complete silence. In the same measure, a capable being elegantly and skillfully negotiates all that may befall one with effortless excellence and quiet reserve.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="\_2cuy \_3dgx"&gt;One may think that Mathematics is the language of the Gods, as I do. Know then, however, that the world may seem ungodly on many occasions. Balancing the idea of self as a construct with the overwhelming presence of every surrounding thing calls for dexterity far greater than I can hope to muster. My obsession with perfection fails me more often than it serves me.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="\_2cuy \_3dgx"&gt;Great deeds are done in time, and every now and then, people of capabilities hitherto unknown are born. I have never felt myself to be among these people. Even fewer decades now remain for me to stand a fleeting glimpse of ascending to such decorations.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="\_2cuy \_3dgx"&gt;Destiny is a powerful tool, they say. I’ve often thought about what they mean. Destiny, logically, refers to the state of some descriptive variables at a time ‘t’, such that, certain laws of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity hold. But, I am an average being, and destiny is a divine concept.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="\_2cuy \_3dgx"&gt;It seems that little deeds provide me lasting pleasure, for better or worse. Therefore, I indulge voraciously in little measures to justify my own lack of greatness. Take, for example, the statement below:&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="\_2cuy \_3dgx"&gt;-  Given $latex  &lt;G, .&gt; $, $latex \\ni $, ($latex H &lt;\_{sub} G $) $latex \\wedge $ ($latex K = \\{ x \\in G : (xax^{-1}) \\in H$, iff, $latex a \\in H \\}$) , prove that $latex K &lt;\_{sub} G$.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="\_2cuy \_3dgx"&gt;- The proof for this, which I put forward not more than a few days ago during a quiet musing, is one among many similar average bases that I use to stitch a plausible argument to convince myself of the reason for my existence. As one may expect, I don’t ever succeed.&lt;/div&gt; 323 2015-12-02 02:25:23 2015-12-02 02:25:23 open closed writings publish 0 0 page 0 \_wp\_page\_template \_publicize\_pending 1 \_rest\_api\_published 1 \_rest\_api\_client\_id -1
Video 3: Grand Solo in D - Fernando Sor + (Improvisation)

I am usually very strict and I don't do improvisations (at least, never on Classical pieces), but I decided to on this one, as D-Major is one of my favorite scales. Fernando Sor was a Classical Guitar composer of the Classical Era. He lived from 1778 - 1839 and shaped many Classical guitar techniques . \[embed\]https://www.facebook.com/juspreet.sandhu/videos/vb.720735160/10154711829050161/?type=3&amp;theater\[/embed\] Enjoy! &nbsp; 327 2015-12-10 02:16:20 2015-12-10 02:16:20 open open video-3-grand-solo-in-d-fernando-sor-improvisation publish 0 0 post 0 Classical Guitar Uncategorized \_oembed\_0c29a082ca39521e2af27688094fef29 {{unknown}} \_publicize\_done\_external a:1:{s:8:"facebook";a:1:{i:12885662;s:38:"https://facebook.com/10156188954275161";}} \_rest\_api\_published 1 \_rest\_api\_client\_id -1 \_publicize\_job\_id 17647419511 \_publicize\_done\_12894847 1 \_wpas\_done\_12885662 1 \_oembed\_39071130cb851d2337f5cf5312c019f8 {{unknown}} publicize\_tumblr\_url http://.tumblr.com/post/134892536103 \_publicize\_done\_12894848 1 \_wpas\_done\_12885663 1 \_oembed\_2739996f1f5ab51242570805bbcd04d8 {{unknown}} publicize\_linkedin\_url https://www.linkedin.com/updates?discuss=&scope=365800305&stype=M&topic=6080540342258515968&type=U&a=gnGa \_publicize\_done\_12894851 1 \_wpas\_done\_12885668 1
Video 4: Prelude in D-Major, Bach (Snapshot)
https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/2015/12/10/video-4-prelude-in-d-major-bwv/ Thu, 10 Dec 2015 02:32:38 +0000 jssandh2 https://juspreetsandhu.wordpress.com/?p=339 This is a snapshot of my rendition of the Prelude in D-Major, part of the BWW 998, Prelude, Fugue and Finale. It is a little faster than most renditions, and considering the 7-8 time signature, may sound a little off, but it is because my phrasing is a little more legato than I believe is conventional.
