<p>Trees<br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;<br />Motivation : Road Repair &rarr; Given G = (V,E), repair the minimum number of roads, s.t., every city is reachable from another, and the price is minimized</p>
<p>Defⁿ : A tree is a connected graph without cycles (Undirected) &equiv; A tree is a connected graph with (|V| - 1) nodes and no cycles (Directed)<br />Defⁿ(Equivalent) : A tree is also a graph G, s.t., &forall; vᵢ,vⱼ &isin; V, &exist; a unique path p(vᵢ &rarr; vⱼ)</p>
<p>These statements are equivalent, and can be proved using transitivity of implications. Proofs rely on simple induction over the vertices for the first proof, and on proof by contradiction for the remaining two implications.</p>

<p>Thᵐ : G = (V, E) is Bi-Partite &hArr; ∄ Odd_Cycle &sub; G<br />Proof : We split into 2 cases -<br /> a) Given : G = (V, E), s.t., G is Bi-Partite<br /> Then, if &exist; Odd_Cycle &sub; G, we see that a vertex v₁ and vₒ must be connected. However, as vₑ &isin; L and vₒ &isin; R, v₁vₒ is an edge in R. This is a contradiction.<br /> b) Given : G = (V, E), s.t., ∄ Odd_Cycle &sub; G<br /> Then, create two sets L, R = &phi; . Choose some v &isin; V, and put all nodes at odd distance in R, and all nodes at even distance in L.<br /> - If there was a path of distance even for some v' &isin; R, then, we have a cycle C = v ... v' .. v, where |C| = Even + Odd = Odd. This is a contradiction.<br /> - If there was a path of distance odd for some v' &isin; L, then, we have a cycle C = v ... v' ... v, where |C| = Odd + Even = Odd. This is a contradiction.<br /> QED</p>
