<h2 id="about-me">ABOUT ME</h2>
<ul>
<li>I'm a Software Engineer in the <strong>Search &amp; Discovery</strong> (S&amp;D) Team at <strong>Tumblr Inc.</strong>. I work primarily on <em>Search Parallelization</em>, <em>Filtering</em> and <em>Relational Modeling</em>.</li>
<li>Before working, I went to school at <a href="http://illinois.edu/">UIUC</a>, where I did my <strong>BS</strong> in <strong>Physics</strong> and received <strong>Minors</strong> in <strong>Mathematics, Computer Science</strong>. I graudated in May, 2015.</li>
<li>While at <strong>UIUC</strong>, I did the following things :
<ul>
<li>An Independent Study under <a href="http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/">Prof. Zhai</a> to investigate the effect of Coreference-Resolution on MAP for Search Queries using the <a href="http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/">stanford-core-nlp</a> package.</li>
<li>Was a <strong>Grader (<a href="https://chara.cs.illinois.edu/sites/cs410">CS-410</a>)</strong> in Spring, 2015.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/interns/2014.html">SPIN Internship</a> at the <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/">NCSA</a> to investigate NLP Algorithms to extract meaningful data from Audio-Conversations by Firemen.</li>
<li>Played Badminton with A-Team for UIUC.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Besides <strong>Academics</strong>, I have a few other interests :
<ul>
<li><strong>Classical Music</strong> : I've been studying Classical Guitar since 2006. I play a <a href="http://www.cordobaguitars.com/p/c9">Cordoba-C9</a> for now (Cedar Top). I'm looking into getting an <a href="http://www.alhambrausa.com/guitars/classical/9/8-p.html">Alhambra-8P</a> or <a href="http://www.alhambrausa.com/guitars/classical/10/9-p.html">Alhambra-9P</a>. I am currently working on the following pieces :
<ul>
<li>BWV-998 in D-Major (Prelude, Fugue &amp; Allegro), J.S. Bach</li>
<li>Recuerdos De La Alhambra, Tarrega</li>
<li>Danza Brasilera, Jorge Morgel</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Badminton</strong> : I started playing Badminton competitively around 2007. I played Zonals and State-Level Badminton in India, and was part of the A-Team at UIUC. Unfortunately, I haven't been playing/training since 2015.</li>
<li><strong>Photography</strong> : I am particularly fond of Nature Photography, Black-and-White Photography and DSLRs with High-Shutter Speeds.
